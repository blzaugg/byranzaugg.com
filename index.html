<h2 style="font-size: 42px; line-height: 1em;">Hello, I&#8217;m Byran.<br />
<span style="font-size: 34px;">I develop and design for the web.</span></h2>
<p><strong>First,</strong> I came from a print design background and was given the opportunity to try my hand at web design—I liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Later,</strong> I was given the chance to dabble in web development<em>—I loved it!</em></p>
<p><strong>Today,</strong> I’m a die-hard for beautifully consistent and usable websites; that are models of UI/UX perfection. I enjoy seeing the results of my labors proving invaluable to end users. I have great pride in the solutions I produce. I'll spend the extra effort, to fix that browser quirk, that’s keeping a product from being just right.</p>
<p>I really enjoy taking someone's problem, thinking through the options, and producing a solution. I find it greatly rewarding when I'm able to to improve their situation.</p>
<!-- <p><strong>Tomorrow?</strong> I aspire to transition into Product Management; to own and shape products and the teams that produce them.</p> -->
<p>While you&#8217;re here, please have a look at my <a title="Resume" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume/" >resume</a> and <a title="Portfolio" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/web-design/" >portfolio</a>. I think you&#8217;ll <em>love</em> what you see.</p>
