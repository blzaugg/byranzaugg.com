<h2 style="font-size: 42px; line-height: 1em;">Hello, I&#8217;m Byran.<br />
<span style="font-size: 34px;">I develop and design for the web.</span></h2>
<p><strong>First,</strong> I came from a print design background and was given the opportunity to try my hand at web design; I liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Later,</strong> I was given the chance to dabble in web development; <em>I loved it!</em></p>
<p><strong>Today,</strong> I&#8217;m a die-hard for pixel-perfect, semantic, web-pages and have a drive for UI/UX perfection. I enjoy seeing the results of my labors; being interactive, useful, and consistent across various browsers. I spend that extra time, fixing that IE quirk that&#8217;s keeping a project from being just right.</p>
<p><strong>What does the future hold?</strong> I&#8217;m excited to see where the web is headed; bringing a &#8220;desktop&#8221; experience to the browser. The tools available online today are astonishing, and I look forward to contributing to them.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re here, please have a look at my <a title="Resume" href="/resume/" >resume</a> and <a title="Portfolio" href="/web-design/" >portfolio</a>. I think you&#8217;ll <em>love</em> what you see.</p>
